A static frontend clone of the Amazon homepage built specifically to demonstrate **responsive web design** and **advanced CSS layout techniques** (Flexbox & Grid). This project focuses on mimicking the visual interface and user experience of Amazon.com without backend functionality.

## 📚 Prerequisite Knowledge

    * Image handling (`img` tags and paths).
* **CSS3 Styling:**
    * **Flexbox:** Used heavily for the navigation bar and product rows.
    * **CSS Grid:** Used for the main product layout gallery.
    * **Media Queries:** Used to make the website responsive (mobile vs. desktop view).
    * **Box Model:** Margins, padding, and borders.
* **Version Control (Optional):**
    * Basic Git commands (`git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`).
